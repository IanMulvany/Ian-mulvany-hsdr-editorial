cat reviewer-comments.txt | llm -m 4t "there are comments from four reviwers, but some of the comments overlap, e.g. questions about use of dimensions. In order to help me address the revier comments carefully read through the reviewer reports, and list out explicit requests from the reviewers where available, with quotes from each reviwer on each topic identified. For each topic also give a list of which reviwers mentioned that theme."
Below, I have compiled a list of the explicit requests and common themes mentioned by the reviewers along with the relevant quotes from each reviewer.
