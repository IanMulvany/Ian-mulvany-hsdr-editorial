at reviewer-comments.txt | llm -m 4t "there are comments from four reviwers, but some of the comments overlap, e.g. questions about use of dimensions. In order to help me address the revier comments carefully read through the reviewer reports, and give me them back collected by topic, with quiotes from each reviwer on each topic identified. For each topic also give a list of which reviwers mentioned that topic."

### Topic 1: Use of Dimensions Data Source and Open Data Sources

#### Reviewer Comments:
- **Reviewer 1**: N/A
- **Reviewer 2**: After a brief introduction that outlines the increase in the rate of publication of papers since the 1960s based on Dimensions (I don't doubt the numbers but this is a closed system - isn't there a more accessible source to cite?).
- **Reviewer 3**: It seems odd in the context of an argument about access to data and open access to use a closed source of data, Dimensions, to commence the argument.
- **Reviewer 4**: N/A

### Topic 2: Clarity and Narrative of the Article

#### Reviewer Comments:
- **Reviewer 1**: The article is a proponent of DemocratizingData.ai but the characteristics of this platform that make it worthy of this view are never explained.
- **Reviewer 2**: The main challenge of this piece is getting these points across clearly.
- **Reviewer 3**: The manuscript presents as a set of notes for a panel talk. It lacks context and background and is difficult to follow as a standalone piece.
- **Reviewer 4**: Since this is an opinion piece, it seems inappropriate to ask whether its assertions are true by some objective standard â€“ they are mostly matters of opinion, which is the whole point.

### Topic 3: Democratizing Data and Specific Examples

#### Reviewer Comments:
- **Reviewer 1**: N/A
- **Reviewer 2**: Finally, I did not come away with a clear picture of the power of data - could an inspirational case study or two be included to help illustrate the potential?
- **Reviewer 3**: Democratizing AI is referenced obliquely several times as a motivating effort, but not explained or positioned with respect to the text.
- **Reviewer 4**: It would be useful to briefly outline the activities of the Democratizing Data project and why it is "exactly that right kind of work" in the context of this piece.

### Topic 4: Document-centric vs. Person-centric View

#### Reviewer Comments:
- **Reviewer 1**: The article describes unique and important opportunities for publishers to serve authors, funders, and the research ecosystem at large by contextualizing publications through this person-centric view.
- **Reviewer 2**: I am not sure I grasped a person-centric view emerging specifically.
- **Reviewer 3**: N/A
- **Reviewer 4**: "[T]he key shift that we are undergoing now is moving from a document centric view of the world to a person centric view of the world." This is arguably true, but probably not for the reasons stated.

### Topic 5: Addressing Risks and Counter-Arguments

#### Reviewer Comments:
- **Reviewer 1**: N/A
- **Reviewer 2**: N/A
- **Reviewer 3**: On the question of content the paper is arguing for what some have critically referred to as "surveillance capitalism" without acknowledging this controversy or addressing risks.
- **Reviewer 4**: N/A

#### Reviewers Mentioning Topic:
- Reviewer 3

### Topic 6: Concrete Examples and Recommendations

#### Reviewer Comments:
- **Reviewer 1**: N/A
- **Reviewer 2**: Some of the paragraphs are quite light and as a consequence are a bit unsatisfying.
- **Reviewer 3**: The manuscript is not referenced and it contains many assertions or statements that would benefit from a more balanced presentation as well as supporting evidence.
- **Reviewer 4**: The section beginning, "The following are some rules of thumb that I hope can help", doesn't really seem to amount to a set of useful rules of thumb.

#### Reviewers Mentioning Topic:
- Reviewer 2
- Reviewer 3
- Reviewer 4

### Topic 7: Structure and Presentation of the Argument

#### Reviewer Comments:
- **Reviewer 1**: N/A
- **Reviewer 2**: The article has a stream of consciousness style that does not help - the thoughts jump around a bit rather than follow a path.
- **Reviewer 3**: For a resubmitted piece I would advise re-organising, providing greater context and developing a clear narrative arc that is independent of the other submissions.
- **Reviewer 4**: I would also recommend copy edits to make some of the sentences shorter, some of the paragraphs longer, and some of the punctuation more consistent and comprehensible.
