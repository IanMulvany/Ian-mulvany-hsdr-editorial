### Topic: Use of Dimensions Data Source and Open Data Sources
#### Reviewer Comments:
- **Reviewer 1**: N/A
- **Reviewer 2**: After a brief introduction that outlines the increase in the rate of publication of papers since the 1960s based on Dimensions (I don't doubt the numbers but this is a closed system - isn't there a more accessible source to cite?).
- **Reviewer 3**: It seems odd in the context of an argument about access to data and open access to use a closed source of data, Dimensions, to commence the argument.
- **Reviewer 4**: N/A

### Topic: Scale and Quality of Information
- Reference to **Reviewer 1**: "The opening statement 'scale is always good' is not substantiated by the rest of the article."
- Reference to **Reviewer 4**: "The assertion that 'scale is always good when it comes to our ability to understand the world' requires some backing up or (better still) qualification."
**Reviewers mentioning this theme**: 1, 4



### Topic: Clarity and Narrative of the Article
#### Reviewer Comments:
- **Reviewer 1**: The article is a proponent of DemocratizingData.ai but the characteristics of this platform that make it worthy of this view are never explained.
- **Reviewer 2**: The main challenge of this piece is getting these points across clearly.
- **Reviewer 3**: The manuscript presents as a set of notes for a panel talk. It lacks context and background and is difficult to follow as a standalone piece.
- **Reviewer 4**: Since this is an opinion piece, it seems inappropriate to ask whether its assertions are true by some objective standard â€“ they are mostly matters of opinion, which is the whole point. 
- **Reviewer 4:** "...it seems more useful to assess whether questions are well-posed and arguments convincingly made. Where might a fair-minded but intrinsically skeptical reader push back?"

### Topic: Democratizing Data and Specific Examples
#### Reviewer Comments:
- **Reviewer 1**: N/A
- **Reviewer 2**: Finally, I did not come away with a clear picture of the power of data - could an inspirational case study or two be included to help illustrate the potential?
- **Reviewer 3**: Democratizing AI is referenced obliquely several times as a motivating effort, but not explained or positioned with respect to the text.
- **Reviewer 4**: It would be useful to briefly outline the activities of the Democratizing Data project and why it is "exactly that right kind of work" in the context of this piece.
- Reference to **Reviewer 1**: "The article is a proponent of DemocratizingData.ai but the characteristics of this platform that make it worthy of this view are never explained."
- **Reviewer 2:** "For example...Any change to a system incurs cost... it makes me wonder what kind of costs..."
- **Reviewer 3:** "The manuscript is not referenced and it contains many assertions or statements that would benefit from a more balanced presentation as well as supporting evidence."
- **Reviewer 4:** "The assertion that 'scale is always good when it comes to our ability to understand the world' requires some backing up..."

### Topic:  Person Centric review 
- **Reviewer 2**: I am not sure I grasped a person-centric view emerging specifically.
- **Reviewer 3**: N/A
- **Reviewer 4**: "[T]he key shift that we are undergoing now is moving from a document centric view of the world to a person centric view of the world." This is arguably true, but probably not for the reasons stated.



### Topic: Addressing Risks and Counter-Arguments
#### Reviewer Comments:
- **Reviewer 1**: N/A
- **Reviewer 2**: N/A
- **Reviewer 3**: On the question of content the paper is arguing for what some have critically referred to as "surveillance capitalism" without acknowledging this controversy or addressing risks.
- **Reviewer 4**: N/A

- Reviewer 3





### Topic: Concrete Examples and Recommendations
- **Reviewer 3**: The manuscript is not referenced and it contains many assertions or statements that would benefit from a more balanced presentation as well as supporting evidence.
- **Reviewer 4**: The section beginning, "The following are some rules of thumb that I hope can help", doesn't really seem to amount to a set of useful rules of thumb.
- Reference to **Reviewer 2**: "Finally, I did not come away with a clear picture of the power of data - could an inspirational case study or two be included to help illustrate the potential?"
- Reference to **Reviewer 3**: "There are several statements of 'things being done' or investments where concrete examples and/or references would be a benefit."

### Topic: Structure and Presentation of the Argument
#### Reviewer Comments:
- **Reviewer 1**: N/A
- **Reviewer 2**: The article has a stream of consciousness style that does not help - the thoughts jump around a bit rather than follow a path.
- **Reviewer 3**: For a resubmitted piece I would advise re-organising, providing greater context and developing a clear narrative arc that is independent of the other submissions.
- **Reviewer 4**: I would also recommend copy edits to make some of the sentences shorter, some of the paragraphs longer, and some of the punctuation more consistent and comprehensible.

### Topic: Engagement with the broader research ecosystem and examples of data integration
**Reviewer Comments:**
- **Reviewer 2:** "I get that this is a publisher's view but what of the wider research ecosystem? How about integration with other sources of information..."
- **Reviewer 4:** "It would be interesting to hear a bit more about how data could break down traditional subject-based silos..."
