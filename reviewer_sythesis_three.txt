cat reviewer-comments.txt | llm -m 4t "there are comments from four reviwers, but some of the comments overlap, e.g. questions about use of dimensions. In order to help me address the revier comments carefully read through the reviewer reports, and list out the most critical comments from the reviewers where available, with quotes from each reviwer on each topic identified. For each topic also give a list of which reviwers mentioned that theme. For each topic prepare a response that I might use when I start to draft my revision"
Certainly, Mr. Mulvany, I can assist you in organizing and consolidating the critical feedback from the reviewers around common themes to facilitate a structured response when you revise your manuscript. Below are the most critical comments grouped by theme, with quotations from each reviewer who mentioned that theme, and a suggested response structure you might use in your revision.

### Theme 1: Lack of a clear narrative and need for reorganization
**Reviewer Comments:**
- **Reviewer 1:** "The presentation and structure of the article, however, obscure these valuable insights."
- **Reviewer 3:** "The manuscript presents as a set of notes for a panel talk...it lacks context and background and is difficult to follow as a standalone piece."
- **Reviewer 4:** "...it seems more useful to assess whether questions are well-posed and arguments convincingly made. Where might a fair-minded but intrinsically skeptical reader push back?"

**Mentioned by Reviewers:** 1, 3, 4

**Suggested Response:**
I acknowledge the constructive feedback regarding the need for a clearer narrative and better-structured organization within my manuscript. In response to these concerns, I have restructured the manuscript to provide a more explicit context and background at the outset. The revised format now guides the reader through a logical progression of arguments, ensuring that each point is substantiated and seamlessly tied to the overarching narrative.

### Theme 2: Clarification and substantiation of claims
**Reviewer Comments:**
- **Reviewer 1:** "The article is a proponent of DemocratizingData.ai but the characteristics of this platform that make it worthy of this view are never explained."
- **Reviewer 2:** "For example...Any change to a system incurs cost... it makes me wonder what kind of costs..."
- **Reviewer 3:** "The manuscript is not referenced and it contains many assertions or statements that would benefit from a more balanced presentation as well as supporting evidence."
- **Reviewer 4:** "The assertion that 'scale is always good when it comes to our ability to understand the world' requires some backing up..."

**Mentioned by Reviewers:** 1, 2, 3, 4

**Suggested Response:**
In the revised manuscript, I have included a detailed explanation of the platform DemocratizingData.ai, outlining its characteristics and the benefits it offers in the context of the discussion. I have also provided additional references and concrete examples to support and balance the statements and assertions made throughout the paper. The importance of quality over sheer scale has been emphasized, and I have now qualified previously unsubstantiated claims to reflect a more nuanced understanding.

### Theme 3: Engagement with the broader research ecosystem and examples of data integration
**Reviewer Comments:**
- **Reviewer 2:** "I get that this is a publisher's view but what of the wider research ecosystem? How about integration with other sources of information..."
- **Reviewer 4:** "It would be interesting to hear a bit more about how data could break down traditional subject-based silos..."

**Mentioned by Reviewers:** 2, 4

**Suggested Response:**
To address the insightful point raised about the intersection of publishers with the wider research ecosystem, the revised manuscript expands upon the integration of publishing data with other sources, such as EHR data, wearables, environmental, and longitudinal data. By doing so, I have highlighted the potential of interoperable data systems to break down subject-based silos, featuring examples that showcase cross-disciplinary connectivity.

### Theme 4: Use of open versus closed sources of data
**Reviewer Comments:**
- **Reviewer 2:** "After a brief introduction...based on Dimensions...isn't there a more accessible source to cite?"
- **Reviewer 3:** "It seems odd in the context...to use a closed source of data, Dimensions, to commence the argument."

**Mentioned by Reviewers:** 2, 3

**Suggested Response:**
Your feedback on the use of data sources has been duly noted. In the revised version of the manuscript, I have incorporated data from both open sources such as OpenAlex and Crossref and compared these with the previously mentioned Dimensions data to mitigate the concerns about relying solely on a closed data source. This inclusion also serves to broaden the perspective and substantiate the trends discussed in the manuscript.

### General Notes for Response to Reviewers:
In addition to addressing these critical comments, I will ensure that each point made in the manuscript is backed by current and relevant literature, coupled with practical examples where possible. I will make certain that the revised manuscript maintains a balanced and critical view of the topics discussed, including acknowledging alternative perspectives and potential controversies where applicable. Furthermore, I will provide a clear indication of the intended audience for the suggestions and rules of thumb discussed in the manuscript.

The reviewers' constructive insights have been invaluable in strengthening the manuscript, and I extend my gratitude for their thorough evaluations. I trust that the revisions made will meet the expectations for publication within HDSR.
