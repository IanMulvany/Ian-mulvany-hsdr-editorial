cat reviewer-comments.txt | llm -m 4t "there are comments from four reviwers, but some of the comments overlap, e.g. questions about use of dimensions. In order to help me address the revier comments carefully read through the reviewer reports, and list out the most critical comments from the reviewers where available, with quotes from each reviwer on each topic identified. For each topic also give a list of which reviwers mentioned that theme. For each topic prepare a response that I might use when I start to draft my revision"
Certainly, Mr. Mulvany, I can assist you in organizing and consolidating the critical feedback from the reviewers around common themes to facilitate a structured response when you revise your manuscript. Below are the most critical comments grouped by theme, with quotations from each reviewer who mentioned that theme, and a suggested response structure you might use in your revision.



**Mentioned by Reviewers:** 2, 3

**Suggested Response:**
Your feedback on the use of data sources has been duly noted. In the revised version of the manuscript, I have incorporated data from both open sources such as OpenAlex and Crossref and compared these with the previously mentioned Dimensions data to mitigate the concerns about relying solely on a closed data source. This inclusion also serves to broaden the perspective and substantiate the trends discussed in the manuscript.

### General Notes for Response to Reviewers:
In addition to addressing these critical comments, I will ensure that each point made in the manuscript is backed by current and relevant literature, coupled with practical examples where possible. I will make certain that the revised manuscript maintains a balanced and critical view of the topics discussed, including acknowledging alternative perspectives and potential controversies where applicable. Furthermore, I will provide a clear indication of the intended audience for the suggestions and rules of thumb discussed in the manuscript.

The reviewers' constructive insights have been invaluable in strengthening the manuscript, and I extend my gratitude for their thorough evaluations. I trust that the revisions made will meet the expectations for publication within HDSR.
